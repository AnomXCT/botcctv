🔗🔥botcctv🎥
  script tools is to access cctv 
  through the termux application, 
  but the cctv that is accessed is 
  only public cctv 
  which means it is not private

🔗🔥Notes..
  -intentionally didn't secure the script to 
   make it easy for beginners who want to learn.
  -If you want to recode the script tools, 
   that's okay, but please don't change the Author name.
